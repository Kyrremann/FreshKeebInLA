Fresh Keeb In LA
-----------------

This was originally made to (hopefully) learn you the strange keyboard layout called
[ASETNIOP](http://asetniop.com/). I've later added my friends Butterstick layout. Your also free to
add your own strange layouts via pull requests!

## How to play

If you have [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) already installed on your computer, you probably know what to do (`love .`). 
Others can download the LÖVE-binary from the [release-page](https://github.com/Kyrremann/FreshKeebInLA/releases), 
but you need download LÖVE from [love2d.org](https://love2d.org/) your self.

## Keyboards/layouts

You can change between keyboards in game with the arrow keys.

### ASETNIOP

Check out their website if you want to learn more. I made this game so I could get some use out of my cool Ginni keyboard
from [gBoards.ca](https://www.gboards.ca/product/ginni).

If you have a Ginny you can download and flash the layout using
[qmk_firmware/gboards](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/gboards) QMK fork.

### Butterstick (chinatsu)
